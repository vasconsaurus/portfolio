  <h3 class="vertical">About me</h3>
  <p>I worked as a graphic designer for over 10 years. I was looking for a new challenge, and that is when I found programming. It was a breath of fresh air. I started learning on my own, later enrolled on a bootcamp, and am still eager to keep learning. It has been a lot of fun.</p>
